PETA vs. AmulVegan milk is basically plant-based juice that resembles the texture, taste, and qualities of conventional animal milk. It can also be used to make many products.

While for some, the reason behind this shift is the cruelty that animals must go through during the process of extraction of milk, vegan milk options have also come of great help to people who are lactose-intolerant or allergic to animal milk. Many believe that vegan milk is a healthier alternative to dairy products.

The various types of vegan milk are soya milk, almond milk, coconut milk, rice milk, almond milk.

Plant milk market size exceeded USD 12 Billion in 2019 and is estimated to achieve over 11% CAGR between 2020 and 2026.It is expected that by 2026 it will grow up to \$21 billion.

The global dairy market was valued at 718.9 billion U.S. dollars in 2019 and was projected to grow to 1032.7 billion U.S. dollars by 2024

The above 2 paras clearly show the dependency of world on animal-based milk and milk products. As of now the vegan milk industry stands nowhere in front of usual animal diary industry.

The difference between vegetarian and vegan-The vegetarians are those who do not consume any kind of meat, flesh, eggs etc. But being a vegan has a different meaning. Vegans are those who not even consume animal milk and milk products. Instead, they consume vegan milk like soy milk, almond milk. etc.

The transition from vegetarians to vegans has been so profound that last year (2019), was declared by The Economist 'The Year of the Vegan'. Right now, the total number of vegans, vegetarians, and all related categories, is close to 14 percent of the world population.

PETA (People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals)- American animal rights organization based in Norfolk, Virginia, and led by Ingrid Newkirk, its international president. The non-profit corporation claims 6.5 million supporters. PETA is one of the major contributors of people being turned into vegan from vegetarian and non-vegetarian community.

Current scenario in India-Recently PETA INDIA suggested about switching the production of animal milk to vegan milk in INDIAN DIARY INDUSTRY.

In response, the owner of Amul diary, the biggest company in Indian diary market hits back PETA concerning the poor employment condition in India. Amul questioned PETA that how the 100 million+ farmers of India will earn their livelihood and hence giving PETA "the taste of India".

A big majority of India thinks that PETA being a west funder NGO is trying to target the Indian diary industry and making profits by introducing their so-called vegan milk which involves use of chemicals during their preparations.

What is your view about PETA.Is it really concerned about animals or just a trick of industrialists to create a new trillion-dollar market?
