The stock markets have boomed throughout the pandemic when the economy wasn't doing very well, still, the indices have tested newer all-time highs. But understanding why it happened is of paramount importance. Let's try to unravel this mystery with Grofi.
Before unboxing the mystery, let us try to know why do we think that the stock markets should have fallen during this economic crisis.

.The most common argument to this is “since the economy is not doing very well, the stock markets should be down”. But the fact is, stock markets don’t mimic the economy in short term. When economies are not doing very well, there is a good chance that the stock markets can do very well and the reverse is equally true. There have been examples in the past when the economy is doing very well but the stock markets come crashing down. Both possibilities exist.

.Now, If the stock market is not economy, then what is stock market?
It basically depicts the collective hope or collective fear exhibited by the participants in the stock market. So hope is one of the primary reasons stock markets are raging up.
But where is this hope coming from?

.All over the world, the central banks, the governments have intervened and they have ensured ample liquidity to the market participants. They have assured that the major corporations will not go bust, they will not be closing down just because of the pandemic whatever that is required to be done like pushing trillions of dollars into the economy, is being done by different governments across the globe, this is giving hope to the participants of the market that the institutions will not close down & it is safe to invest in the stock market, this is one of the reasons why markets are rallying.

.Equities look to be more attractive than other investment avenues, the bank rates are quite low, also the 10-year bond yields when compared to dividend yields of the equities are much lower ,so it is easier for people to invest in equities and get a higher yield than the bonds or the bank FD's. Also there is a drastic increase in no. of new investors. The no. of new Demat accounts during the lockdown had broken the roofs.

.Few segments of the market did extremely well in spite of the drowning economy, the airlines or tourism industry was not doing very well , but the valuation of technology companies like Facebook ,Netflix, google ,Microsoft boomed, as functioning of any of these technology companies didn’t come down rather went up and so NASDAQ is making lifetime highs when the world is going through a pandemic ,similar story in other parts of the world ,also the companies which are the major components of the stock markets are the technology companies today, even in Nifty and Sensex, the weightage of IT is high and they outperformed.

.The market is very hopeful of the future because of the vaccine, many vaccines have been discovered and people are being vaccinated, normalcy will certainly be regained within a short period, thus a hope that the economy will slowly start limping back to normalcy is a reason markets are very very hopeful and they are rallying.

.Apart from these reasons, we have witnessed an increasing demand for FMCG, consumer goods, pharma, metals, and fertilizers which led to an overall increase in the markets.
Also, We saw high inflow of money in the Indian stock markets by the Foreign Institutional Investors (FIIs), the main driver of Indian equities invested more than ₹2.75 trillion (\$37 billion) in the stock markets in fiscal 2020-21, the highest in the last two decades, as per data from National Securities Depository Ltd which pumped the stock market.
