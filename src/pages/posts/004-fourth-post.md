The term “personal finance” refers to how you manage your money and plan for your future. All of your financial decisions and activities affect your financial health. It is all about managing your personal budget and how best to invest your money to realize your goals.

### Aspects of Personal Finance:

Here are the 5 aspects of a complete financial picture:
Savings: You need to keep money aside as savings to cover any sudden financial need.
Investing: Investing is important to grow money so that you can achieve what you aspire.
Financial protection: Now, financial protection through insurance ensures you and your family can sail through the hard times.

**Tax planning**: With proper tax planning, i.e. making adequate expenditure/investment, you can bring down your taxable income, eventually saving a lot of money every year.

**Retirement planning**: Finally, retirement planning is crucial to ensure that you have a big bank balance meant solely for your needs during the twilight years.

Now, what funds should one pick as per their financial goals?

**Short-term goals**: The goals that need to be achieved within three years are short-term goals. From saving for a trip to saving for a phone, there are multiple things for which one needs to arrange funds within this timeframe.

**Best investment options**: Liquid Funds, Ultra short-term funds.
Mid-term goals: If you have set a goal for yourself that needs to be achieved within three to five years, for example - down payment for a house, it can be termed as mid-term goals.
Best investment options: Hybrid Funds, ELSS, Short Term Debt funds like Banking and PSU Debt Funds
Long-term goals: Milestone events like retirement, children's education, their marriage, i.e. the goals for which the timeframe is a minimum of 5 years are termed as long-term goals.

**Best investment options**: Multi-Cap Funds, NPS (only for retirement), Large Cap Funds.

### Why start early?

It’s often said that it’s never too late to start saving for retirement. That may be true (technically), but the sooner you start, the better off you’ll likely be during your retirement years. This is because of the power of compounding—what Albert Einstein called the “eighth wonder of the world.”

Compounding involves the reinvestment of earnings, and it is most successful over time. The longer earnings are reinvested, the greater the value of the investment, and the larger the earnings will (hypothetically) be.
To illustrate the importance of starting early, assume you want to save $1,000,000 by the time you turn 60. If you start saving when you are 20 years old, you would have to contribute $655.30 a month—a total of $314,544 over 40 years—to be a millionaire by the time you hit 60. If you waited until you were 40, your monthly contribution would bump up to $2,432.89—a total of $583,894 over 20 years. Wait until 50 and you’d have to come up with $6,439.88 each month —equal to \$772,786 over the 10 years.

The sooner you start, the easier it is to reach your long-term financial goals. You will need to save less each month and contribute less overall, to reach the same goal in the future.

"Personal finance" is too often an intimidating term that causes people to avoid planning, which can spend within your means and manage lifestyle expectations. Aside from planning for the future, start putting away money today for savings goals, including retirement, leisure, and emergency purposes.
